# Fruit_CNN
Testing several CNN architectures with different parameters to recognise types of fruit using 360-fruits dataset.

Two scripts are used, one coming from Pytorch models tutorials (Transfer_learning.py, see the link in comment in the script) for feature extraction, and the other one is an architecture example seen in courses (selfCNN.py).

The dataset is coming from an article:
Horea Muresan, Mihai Oltean, Fruit recognition from images using deep learning, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Informatica Vol. 10, Issue 1, pp. 26-42, 2018.

Repositories Training and Test have to be renamed into "train" and "val" respectively to don't have script issues.
