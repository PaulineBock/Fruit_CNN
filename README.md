# Fruit_CNN
Testing several CNN architectures with different parameters to recognise types of fruit using 360-fruits dataset.

2 scripts are used, one coming from Pytorch models tutorials (see the link in comment in the script) for feature extraction, and the other one is an architecture example seen in courses.

The dataset is coming from an article:
Horea Muresan, Mihai Oltean, Fruit recognition from images using deep learning, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Informatica Vol. 10, Issue 1, pp. 26-42, 2018.
